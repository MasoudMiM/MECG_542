We developed a semi-analytical fibre bundle model to simulate the longitudinal tensile failure of large composite bundles of continuous fibres. The model uses shear-lag to calculate the stress recovery along broken fibres, and an efficient field superposition method to calculate the stress concentration on the intact fibres, which has been validated against analytical and FE results from the literature.
The baseline version of the model uses static equilibrium stress states, and considers fibre failure driven by strength of materials (stress overload) as the only damage theory which can drive bundle failure. Like other models in the literature, the baseline model fails to capture the correct size effect (decreasing composite strength with bundle size) shown by experimental results.
Two model variants have been developed which include dynamics stress concentrations (model DE) and a fracture mechanics (model FM) failure criterion respectively. To the knowledge of the authors, it is the first attempt in the literature to investigate these two effects in a fibre bundle model by direct simulation of large composite bundles.
